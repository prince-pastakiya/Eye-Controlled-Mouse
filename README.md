Overview:

This project uses MediaPipe's Face Mesh and OpenCV to create an eye-controlled mouse. The program uses the webcam to track the user's eyes and moves the mouse cursor accordingly. It also detects when the user blinks and simulates a mouse click.

Requirements:

1. OpenCV
2. MediaPipe
3. PyAutoGUI 

How to Use:

1. Install the required libraries by running "pip install opencv-python mediapipe pyautogui in your terminal."
2. Run the script using Python (e.g., python eye_controlled_mouse.py).
3. The program will start capturing video from your webcam and display it in a window.
4. Look at the webcam and move your eyes to control the mouse cursor.
5. Blink to simulate a mouse click.
